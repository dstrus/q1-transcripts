Hey, everyone. Welcome to Kenzie Academy. I'm Davey Strus.

Before we dive in, let's make sure we have a standard set of tools. It's not impossible to get the job done with other tools, but we like to standardize for a couple of reasons.

First, teaching with common tools allows us to focus on our actual learning objectives, rather than troubleshooting obscure differences between different development environments.

Secondly, we have a decent amount of industry experience, and we've found that certain tools make our jobs easier than others. So if you use the same tools that we use, you'll benefit from our experience with those tools.

Sound good?

We'll start with three tools: the computer's operating system, the web browser, and the code editor.

At Kenzie, we use [MacBook](https://www.apple.com/macbook/) hardware, which means our operating system is [macOS](https://www.apple.com/macos/).

We've standardized on the [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/b/) web browser from Google, and in the first few lessons, we'll be using [Glitch](https://glitch.com/), a web-based code editor. Glitch is an IDE, or Integrated Development Environment, which is essentially a fancy way of saying "code editor." But you can impress your friends by calling it an IDE.

We've gathered some links and designed some activities over the next few pages to help you get started with macOS, Chrome, and Glitch.

Until next time, I'm Davey Strus. Haaaappy hacking!
